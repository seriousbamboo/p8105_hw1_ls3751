```

## Problem 1

#### 1.1 Data frame

``` r
sample_df <- tibble(
  vec_norm = rnorm(10), 
  vec_logical = vec_norm > 0,
  vec_char = LETTERS [1:10],
  vec_factor = factor(c("A","A","A","B","B","B","B","B","C","C"))
)
```

#### 1.2 Calculating the mean of each variable

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df,vec_norm))
## [1] -0.4167843
mean(pull(sample_df,vec_logical))
## [1] 0.4
mean(pull(sample_df,vec_char))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(sample_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
mean(pull(sample_df,vec_factor))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(sample_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
```

**Numeric** and **logical** vectors did generate the mean. It turns out
the the mean of **character vector** and **factor vector** returns
**NA**. Given the mean of logical vector is 0.4 and the number of TRUE
is 4,it is reasonable to assume that True equals to 1 and False equals
to 0 in the logical vector.

#### 1.3 convert vectors

##### try as.numeric function

``` r
as.numeric(pull(sample_df,vec_norm))
as.numeric(pull(sample_df,vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(sample_df,vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(sample_df,vec_factor))
```

The result supports the assumption that TRUE equals to 1 while FALSE
equals to 0. The character vector failed to transform to numeric manner.
The factor variable, however, was digitialized according to levels.

##### convert logical vector into other form and calculate

``` r
#convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result
as.numeric(pull(sample_df,vec_logical))*pull(sample_df,vec_norm)
#convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random sample by the result
as.factor(pull(sample_df,vec_logical))*pull(sample_df,vec_norm)
#convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result
factor_vec = as.factor(pull(sample_df,vec_logical))
as.numeric(factor_vec)*pull(sample_df,vec_norm)
```

## Problem 2

#### 2.1 Load the pengins dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### 2.2 Description of the penguins dataset

##### Overview

> The penguins dataset has 8 variables, including species, island,
> bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g,
> sex, year; It has **344** rows and **8** columns; The mean flipper
> length is 200.92 mm.

  - The variable **species** is a factor variable, with 3 levels:
    Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo.
  - The variable **island** is a factor variable, with 3 levels: Biscoe,
    Dream, Torgersen.
  - The variable **bill\_length\_mm** is a numeric variable (Max: 59.6,
    Min: 32.1, Mean: 43.92, Median: 44.45).
  - The variable **bill\_depth\_mm** is a numeric variable (Max: 21.5,
    Min: 13.1, Mean: 17.15, Median: 17.3).
  - The variable **flipper\_length\_mm** is a integer variable (Max:
    231, Min: 172, Mean: 200.92, Median: 197).
  - The variable **body\_mass\_g** is a integer variable (Max: 6300,
    Min: 2700, Mean: 4201.75, Median: 4050).
  - The variable **sex** is a factor variable, with 2 levels: female,
    male.
  - The variable **year** is a integer variable (Max: 2009, Min: 2007,
    Median: 2008).

#### 2.3 Plotting and exporting

##### Flipper\_length\_mm (y) vs bill\_length\_mm (x)

``` r
plot_flipper_billL <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
plot_flipper_billL
```

*(excluded the missing values)*

##### Export and save the plot

``` r
ggsave('plot_flipper_billL.png', plot = plot_flipper_billL)
```
